# os-builder

This repository contains code for building operating systems that can be deployed on edge devices using bootc (bootable containers) technology.

## Overview

This project provides container-based OS builds for edge computing deployments using bootc technology, which enables:

- Immutable OS updates via container images
- Transactional updates with rollback capability
- Container-native OS management
- Edge-optimized configurations

## Available OS Builds

### Fedora bootc Edge OS (`os/`)

A complete Fedora-based bootc container image optimized for edge deployments.

**Features:**

- Based on Fedora 42 bootc base image
- Container runtime (Podman) pre-installed
- **MicroShift Kubernetes built from source** for latest features and customization
- **Offline Container Support**: Pre-loaded MicroShift container images for offline deployment
- **Observability Stack**: OpenTelemetry Collector for metrics, logs, and traces
- SSH access with security hardening
- Automatic updates capability
- Edge-specific optimizations
- **Supply Chain Security**: SHA digest-based immutable container references
- **ISO Building**: Create bootable ISOs with user configuration
  - Interactive installation wizard with user prompts
  - User account setup with SSH keys
  - Custom hostname and DNS configuration (DHCP or static IP)
  - Filesystem customizations with multiple layout options
  - Automated via GitHub Actions

**Quick Start:**

```bash
cd os/
make build                              # Build with MicroShift main branch
make build MICROSHIFT_VERSION=release-4.17  # Build with specific MicroShift version
make test
```

**Documentation:** See [os/README.md](os/README.md) for detailed instructions.

**MicroShift Source Build:** MicroShift is built from source for latest features.
See [docs/MICROSHIFT_SOURCE_BUILD.md](docs/MICROSHIFT_SOURCE_BUILD.md) for details.

**Versioning:** Container images are automatically versioned using GitVersion.
See [docs/GITVERSION.md](docs/GITVERSION.md) for details.

**Interactive Installation:** Guide for the interactive ISO installation process.
See [docs/INTERACTIVE_INSTALLATION.md](docs/INTERACTIVE_INSTALLATION.md) for details.

**ISO Building:** Complete guide for building bootable ISOs.
See [docs/ISO_BUILDING.md](docs/ISO_BUILDING.md) for details.

### RHEL bootc (Legacy - `os/Dockerfile`)

The original RHEL-based bootc configuration with MicroShift.
