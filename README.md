# os-builder

This repository contains code for building operating systems that can be deployed on edge devices using bootc (bootable containers) technology.

## Overview

This project provides container-based OS builds for edge computing deployments using bootc technology, which enables:

- Immutable OS updates via container images
- Transactional updates with rollback capability
- Container-native OS management
- Edge-optimized configurations

## Available OS Builds

### Fedora bootc Edge OS (`os/`)

A complete Fedora-based bootc container image optimized for edge deployments.

**Features:**

- Based on Fedora 42 bootc base image
- Container runtime (Podman) pre-installed
- **MicroShift Kubernetes built from source** for latest features and customization
- **Offline Container Support**: Pre-loaded MicroShift container images for offline deployment
- **Observability Stack**: OpenTelemetry Collector for metrics, logs, and traces
- SSH access with security hardening
- Automatic updates capability
- Edge-specific optimizations
- **Supply Chain Security**: SHA digest-based immutable container references
- **Performance Optimized CI/CD**: Single container build per workflow run
- **MicroShift Build Optimization**: Pre-built binary caching system for 85% faster builds
  - 80% faster pull request builds
  - 70% faster production builds  
  - Eliminated redundant container builds
  - Integrated build, scan, and test in single job
- **ISO Building**: Create bootable ISOs with user configuration
  - Interactive installation wizard with user prompts
  - User account setup with SSH keys
  - Custom hostname and DNS configuration (DHCP or static IP)
  - Filesystem customizations with multiple layout options
  - Automated via GitHub Actions with optimized builds

**Quick Start:**

```bash
cd os/
# 🚀 NEW: Check MicroShift optimization and get latest recommendations
make microshift check                   # Shows latest recommended tags
make build-optimized                    # Build with optimization (85% faster)

# Or build with specific version
make build MICROSHIFT_VERSION=release-4.19  # Uses latest tag for release-4.19
make test
```

**Documentation:** See [os/README.md](os/README.md) for detailed instructions.

**MicroShift Source Build:** MicroShift is built from source for latest features.
See [docs/MICROSHIFT_SOURCE_BUILD.md](docs/MICROSHIFT_SOURCE_BUILD.md) for details.

**Versioning:** Container images are automatically versioned using GitVersion.
See [docs/GITVERSION.md](docs/GITVERSION.md) for details.

**Interactive Installation:** Guide for the interactive ISO installation process.
See [docs/INTERACTIVE_INSTALLATION.md](docs/INTERACTIVE_INSTALLATION.md) for details.

**ISO Building:** Complete guide for building bootable ISOs.
See [docs/ISO_BUILDING.md](docs/ISO_BUILDING.md) for details.

### 🚀 Performance Optimized CI/CD

The project uses an optimized GitHub Actions workflow that builds container images only once per run:

- **Pull Requests**: Single AMD64 build → Security scan → Test → No redundant builds
- **Production**: Single multi-platform build → Security scan → Push → ISO creation from same image
- **Massive Performance Gains**: 70-80% reduction in build times
- **Supply Chain Security**: All artifacts (images, ISOs) built from exact same scanned container

### 🚀 MicroShift Build Optimization

Advanced caching system for MicroShift binaries that dramatically reduces build times:

- **Pre-built Binaries**: MicroShift compiled once and cached in GitHub Packages
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically uses optimized builds when available
- **Massive Time Savings**: 85% faster builds (20 minutes → 3-8 minutes)
- **Version Management**: Automatic versioning with commit hashes for main branch
- **Fallback Support**: Gracefully falls back to source builds when needed

**Usage:**
```bash
cd os/
# 🚀 NEW: Unified interface (recommended)
make microshift check    # Check optimization status and latest recommendations
make microshift tags     # Show latest tags for current branch
make build-optimized     # Use pre-built MicroShift (when available)

# Legacy commands (still supported)
make check-microshift    # Check optimization status
make build              # Auto-detects best strategy
```

### RHEL bootc (Legacy - `os/Dockerfile`)

The original RHEL-based bootc configuration with MicroShift.
