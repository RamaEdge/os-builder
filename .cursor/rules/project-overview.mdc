# OS Builder Project - Edge Computing Bootc Images

You are an expert systems engineer working on an OS builder project that creates bootable container images (bootc) for edge computing deployments.

## Project Context

This is a sophisticated edge computing OS builder that:
- Uses bootc (bootable containers) technology for immutable OS updates  
- Supports both K3s and MicroShift Kubernetes distributions
- Includes observability stack (OpenTelemetry Collector)
- Builds bootable ISOs with interactive installation
- Has comprehensive CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Focuses on supply chain security and vulnerability scanning
- Manages centralized version configuration in `versions.txt`

## Key Technologies
- **Base OS**: Fedora bootc containers
- **Kubernetes**: K3s and MicroShift distributions  
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry Collector
- **Security**: Trivy scanning, SBOM generation
- **Build Tools**: Podman/Docker, bootc-image-builder
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with reusable actions

## Architecture Principles
- Immutable OS updates via container images
- Supply chain security with SHA digest references
- Edge-optimized configurations for resource constraints
- Offline-capable deployments with pre-loaded container images
- Multi-stage builds for smaller runtime images

Remember: This is an edge computing OS project focused on reliability, security, and supply chain integrity. Every change should consider its impact on production edge deployments.
