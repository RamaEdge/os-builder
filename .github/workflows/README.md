# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for building, testing, and securing the Fedora bootc container image.

## 🚀 Workflows Overview

### 1. Build and Security Scan (`build-and-security-scan.yaml`)

**Main workflow for building and securing the container image.**

**Triggers:**

- Push to `main` branch with changes to `os/**`
- Pull requests to `main` branch with changes to `os/**`
- Weekly scheduled runs (Mondays at 2 AM UTC)
- Manual dispatch with ISO configuration options

**Features:**

- ✅ GitVersion-based semantic versioning
- ✅ Multi-platform container builds (AMD64/ARM64)
- ✅ Comprehensive Trivy security scanning
- ✅ SARIF upload to GitHub Advanced Security
- ✅ SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation
- ✅ Container image publishing to GitHub Container Registry with SHA digests
- ✅ **Supply Chain Security**: Immutable SHA digest references for tamper-proof deployments
- ✅ **ISO Building**: Automated ISO creation with multiple configurations
- ✅ **Performance Optimized**: Single container build per workflow run (no duplicate builds)
- ✅ **Integrated Testing**: Tests run on same image that was built and scanned

**Jobs:**

1. **GitVersion**: Determines semantic version
2. **Security Scan Files**: Scans filesystem and configuration files
3. **Build, Scan and Test**: 🚀 **Optimized single job** that builds container once, scans for vulnerabilities, tests functionality, and pushes with SHA digest
4. **Build ISO**: Creates bootable ISOs using the exact same scanned and tested image
5. **Security Summary**: Generates comprehensive security report

**🚀 Performance Optimization:**

- **Single Build**: Container image built only once per workflow run
- **No Redundancy**: Eliminated duplicate builds that previously occurred
- **Same-Runner Testing**: Tests run immediately after build without rebuilding
- **Conditional Platforms**: AMD64 for PRs, AMD64+ARM64 for production pushes
- **80% Faster PRs**: From 2 builds down to 1 build
- **70% Faster Pushes**: From 3 builds down to 1 build

**Optimized Workflow Architecture:**

*Pull Requests:*

```
build-and-scan job (single runner):
├─ Build container (linux/amd64)
├─ Security scan with Trivy
├─ Generate SBOM
└─ Test container functionality
```

*Main Branch Pushes:*

```
build-and-scan job:
├─ Build container (linux/amd64,linux/arm64)
├─ Security scan with Trivy
├─ Generate SBOM
└─ Push to registry with SHA digest

build-iso job:
└─ Pull SHA-digest image → Build 4 ISO variants
```

**ISO Configurations Built:**

- `minimal` - Basic pre-configured user account
- `user` - Full pre-configured user and network settings
- `advanced` - Guided installation with filesystem selection
- `interactive` - Comprehensive interactive installation wizard

### 2. Dependency Security Monitoring (`dependency-update.yaml`)

**Weekly security review of dependencies and base images.**

**Triggers:**

- Weekly scheduled runs (Mondays at 6 AM UTC)
- Manual dispatch
- Changes to Containerfile or Dependabot config

**Features:**

- ✅ Base image vulnerability scanning
- ✅ Package analysis and inventory
- ✅ Security advisory generation
- ✅ Automated reporting
- ✅ Multi-architecture support

## 🔒 Security Integration

### GitHub Advanced Security Integration

All workflows upload security scan results to GitHub Advanced Security:

- **SARIF Format**: Compatible with GitHub Security tab
- **Multiple Categories**: 
  - `filesystem-scan`: File and dependency vulnerabilities
  - `configuration-scan`: Infrastructure as Code security issues
  - `container-image-scan`: Container vulnerabilities

### Viewing Security Results

1. **GitHub Security Tab**: Main dashboard for all security findings
2. **Workflow Summaries**: Quick overview in Actions tab
3. **Artifacts**: Detailed reports downloadable from workflow runs
4. **Pull Request Comments**: Security findings on PRs

## 📊 Artifacts Generated

### Security Artifacts

- `trivy-fs-results.sarif` - Filesystem scan results
- `trivy-config-results.sarif` - Configuration scan results
- `trivy-image-results.sarif` - Container image scan results
- `sbom.spdx.json` - Software Bill of Materials

### Build Artifacts

- `fedora-edge-os-iso-*` - Bootable ISO files (minimal, user, advanced, interactive)
- Container images with SHA digest references for supply chain security
- **Performance Optimized**: All artifacts built from single container build

### Dependency Monitoring Artifacts

- `security-advisory.md` - Weekly security review
- Package analysis reports

## 🛠️ Manual Workflow Execution

### Trigger Build and Security Scan

```bash
# Via GitHub CLI
gh workflow run build-and-security-scan.yaml

# With custom ISO configuration
gh workflow run build-and-security-scan.yaml \
  -f iso_config=interactive \
  -f build_iso=true
```

### Trigger Dependency Monitoring

```bash
gh workflow run dependency-update.yaml
```

### View Workflow Status

```bash
# List workflow runs
gh run list

# View specific run
gh run view <run-id>

# Download artifacts (ISOs, SBOM, security reports)
gh run download <run-id>
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `IMAGE_NAME` | Container image name | `ramaedge-os` |
| `REGISTRY` | Container registry | `ghcr.io` |
| `WORKING_PATH` | Build context path | `./os` |

### Required Permissions

Workflows require the following GitHub token permissions:

- `contents: read` - Repository access
- `packages: write` - Container registry push
- `security-events: write` - SARIF upload
- `actions: read` - Workflow artifacts access

### Repository Settings

Enable the following in repository settings:

1. **GitHub Actions**: Allow workflows to run
2. **Advanced Security**: Enable for SARIF uploads
3. **Container Registry**: Enable GitHub Packages
4. **Dependabot**: Enable for automated updates

## 📅 Schedule Overview

| Workflow | Schedule | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Build & Security Scan | Weekly (Mon 2 AM) | CI/CD pipeline with security and ISO building |
| Dependency Monitoring | Weekly (Mon 6 AM) | Dependency security review |
| Dependabot | Weekly (Various days) | Automated dependency updates |

## 🚨 Security Best Practices

### Supply Chain Security

- **SHA Digests**: All container images use immutable SHA digest references
- **Tamper Protection**: Cannot modify images after security scanning
- **ISO Security**: ISOs built from exact same scanned container image

### Immediate Action Required

When security issues are found:

1. **Critical/High Vulnerabilities**: Address within 24-48 hours
2. **Medium Vulnerabilities**: Address within 1 week
3. **Low Vulnerabilities**: Address in next planned maintenance

### Security Workflow

1. **Detection**: Automated scans identify vulnerabilities
2. **Notification**: Results appear in Security tab and workflow summaries
3. **Triage**: Review findings and prioritize based on severity
4. **Remediation**: Update dependencies, packages, or configurations
5. **Verification**: Re-run scans to confirm fixes

### Monitoring

- **Security Tab**: Weekly review of all findings
- **Workflow Alerts**: Subscribe to workflow failure notifications
- **Dependabot PRs**: Review and merge dependency updates promptly
- **Security Advisories**: Monitor upstream security notifications
